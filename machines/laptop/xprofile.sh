# Laptop-only ~/.xprofile fragment. Sourced (not executed) by config/.xprofile
# after it exports MACHINE_ROLE, so everything here runs in LightDM's login
# session before i3 starts and is inherited by i3 and every program it
# launches.
#
# POSIX sh, not zsh, on purpose: LightDM runs ~/.xprofile with sh, and this
# file is sourced into that same shell. It is the same deliberate exception to
# the zsh-only rule as config/.xprofile itself. No shebang because it is a
# fragment meant to be sourced, never run.
#
# Nothing yet: the laptop has no role-only X session setup. This file exists
# so the role slot is ready (config/.xprofile only sources it when readable).
